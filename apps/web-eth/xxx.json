    "introduction": "0G Labs: Comprehensive Introduction\nCompany Overview\n0G Labs (Zero Gravity Labs) is a pioneering blockchain company focused on decentralized AI infrastructure, which officially launched its Aristotle Mainnet on September 22, 2025—a landmark achievement in the decentralized AI space. The company positions itself as the creator of the world's first decentralized AI operating system (dAIOS), backed by over $325 million in total funding to advance this groundbreaking technology.\nFounding and Leadership\n0G Labs was founded in 2022 by Michael Heinrich and Thomas Yao, both Stanford graduate school alumni who connected within Silicon Valley's innovation ecosystem. Michael Heinrich serves as CEO, an experienced serial entrepreneur with deep expertise at the intersection of decentralized AI and blockchain technology. The founding narrative traces back to their overlapping time at Stanford, where they envisioned decentralizing AI to enhance accountability and accessibility. The team also includes co-founders Ming Wu (CTO) and Fan Long, bringing top-tier expertise in cryptography and distributed systems.\nRecent Major Developments\nThe company marked a major breakthrough with the Aristotle Mainnet launch on September 22, 2025, featuring the largest day-one ecosystem in decentralized AI. This rollout coincided with the Token Generation Event (TGE), enabling official access for node operators, developers, and the broader community. The Aristotle platform is an AI-optimized modular Layer 1 solution integrating decentralized storage, following benchmarks exceeded on Testnet V3 (Galileo) for throughput and finality.\nFunding and Investment\n0G Labs has secured over $325 million in funding, including a $35 million Pre-Seed round in March 2024, a $40 million Seed round in November 2024, and $30 million raised by the 0G Foundation via AI node sales and token subscriptions. This capital is dedicated to developing the world's first decentralized AI operating system, reflecting strong investor confidence in its vision for a decentralized alternative to traditional AI infrastructure. The funding fuels ambitious goals to build comprehensive dAIOS technology rivaling centralized systems.\nTechnology Architecture\nAt the core of 0G Labs is a modular, layered architecture forming the foundation of its scalable and secure data availability layer. The system operates as a modular Layer 1 blockchain tailored for decentralized AI infrastructure (DeAIOS), integrating scalable storage, data availability, and consensus mechanisms. It employs a sophisticated multi-consensus model for coordinating and ordering network activities, crucial for robust decentralized AI applications. This modular design enhances data availability for high-performance apps while upholding decentralization. The Aristotle Mainnet supports up to 50GB/s throughput and on-chain AI inference for transparent, secure, and verifiable execution.\nMarket Position and Vision\n0G Labs has established itself as a leader in the burgeoning decentralized AI sector, delivering modular infrastructure that overcomes traditional blockchain constraints through superior data storage and availability solutions. Its vision is to democratize AI by dismantling centralized control dominating the industry. By focusing on a complete decentralized AI operating system, the company uniquely positions itself to provide foundational infrastructure for other DeAI applications. With the recent mainnet launch, over 100 ecosystem partners (e.g., Chainlink, Google Cloud), and substantial funding, 0G Labs is primed to spearhead the next era of innovation in decentralized AI technology.\n\n\nCommunity Management Team\n<@502466616475385867> - Community Lead, responsible for collaboration and partnerships\n<@1039826291626606682> - Community Moderator\n<@1075063597698400317> - Community Moderator\n\nCommunity Forms and Appeal Channels\nClosed Forms\n1.

The company positions itself as the creator of the world's first decentralized AI operating system (dAIOS), backed by over $325 million in total funding to advance this groundbreaking technology.\nFounding and Leadership\n0G Labs was founded in 2022 by Michael Heinrich and Thomas Yao, both Stanford graduate school alumni who connected within Silicon Valley's innovation ecosystem. Michael Heinrich serves as CEO, an experienced serial entrepreneur with deep expertise at the intersection of decentralized AI and blockchain technology. The founding narrative traces back to their overlapping time at Stanford, where they envisioned decentralizing AI to enhance accountability and accessibility. The team also includes co-founders Ming Wu (CTO) and Fan Long, bringing top-tier expertise in cryptography and distributed systems.\nRecent Major Developments\nThe company marked a major breakthrough with the Aristotle Mainnet launch on September 22, 2025, featuring the largest day-one ecosystem in decentralized AI. This rollout coincided with the Token Generation Event (TGE), enabling official access for node operators, developers, and the broader community. The Aristotle platform is an AI-optimized modular Layer 1 solution integrating decentralized storage, following benchmarks exceeded on Testnet V3 (Galileo) for throughput and finality.\nFunding and Investment\n0G Labs has secured over $325 million in funding, including a $35 million Pre-Seed round in March 2024, a $40 million Seed round in November 2024, and $30 million raised by the 0G Foundation via AI node sales and token subscriptions. This capital is dedicated to developing the world's first decentralized AI operating system, reflecting strong investor confidence in its vision for a decentralized alternative to traditional AI infrastructure. The funding fuels ambitious goals to build comprehensive dAIOS technology rivaling centralized systems.\nTechnology Architecture\nAt the core of 0G Labs is a modular, layered architecture forming the foundation of its scalable and secure data availability layer. The system operates as a modular Layer 1 blockchain tailored for decentralized AI infrastructure (DeAIOS), integrating scalable storage, data availability, and consensus mechanisms. It employs a sophisticated multi-consensus model for coordinating and ordering network activities, crucial for robust decentralized AI applications. This modular design enhances data availability for high-performance apps while upholding decentralization. The Aristotle Mainnet supports up to 50GB/s throughput and on-chain AI inference for transparent, secure, and verifiable execution.\nMarket Position and Vision\n0G Labs has established itself as a leader in the burgeoning decentralized AI sector, delivering modular infrastructure that overcomes traditional blockchain constraints through superior data storage and availability solutions. Its vision is to democratize AI by dismantling centralized control dominating the industry. By focusing on a complete decentralized AI operating system, the company uniquely positions itself to provide foundational infrastructure for other DeAI applications. With the recent mainnet launch, over 100 ecosystem partners (e.g., Chainlink, Google Cloud), and substantial funding, 0G Labs is primed to spearhead the next era of innovation in decentralized AI technology.\n\n\nCommunity Management Team\n<@502466616475385867> - Community Lead, responsible for collaboration and partnerships\n<@1039826291626606682> - Community Moderator\n<@1075063597698400317> - Community Moderator\n\nCommunity Forms and Appeal Channels\nClosed Forms\n1.
