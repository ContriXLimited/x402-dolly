Hi everyone! I'm Hardman from AskDolly. We're building the future micro-knowledge marketplace.

---

Five months ago, we created a well-known AI moderator called AskDolly. We're glad to have served more than 1.5 million users and collaborated with over 20 communities through Discord and Telegram.

---

While communities are amazed by our product, one question from users has raised our attention: The process to get a direct answer to a professional question regarding a community takes too long. Usually the journey looks like this: User has a question, then they spend a long time visiting the project website, but most of the time they still can't find the answer. So they search for the community's Discord link, join the Discord server, post the question, and finally wait for a reply. But all they want is just one thing: "I want this answer now!" They're even willing to pay a little rather than waste all this time.

---

X402 makes this impossible possible, and there are even broader demands beyond this simple quest. Users can pay-as-you-go to get immediate responses, and communities can offer pay-as-you-go services to create a better user experience for their members.

---

Our product includes three components: Knowledge Dashboard - upload data and auto-generate agents in minutes. Agent Marketplace - discover and use agents with a Chat2Earn model. X402 SDK - one line of code to embed payment-enabled AI anywhere.

---

This is not only a service - we see the future micro-knowledge marketplace here. We can introduce and integrate this service to any professional individuals or communities. Their knowledge pool is now turning into a plugin on their website, and different parties can pay-as-they-go to get the most direct and exact answers. For those who are suffering from getting small amounts of info - maybe just 1-2 pieces of information from RootData - instead of a $20 subscription fee, they now pay only for this info, not for the whole subscription they would never use for the rest of the 29 days.

This is our Landing Page. You can explore our Agent Marketplace or try our embedded SDK. First, let's check out the Agent Marketplace. I'll ask LXDAO's agent how to join LXDAO. As you can see, I get an instant answer after the micropayment. Now, let's try the SDK integration. I'll ask a question, sign the transaction with my wallet, and there we go - I get the answer immediately. The creator just earned money, and I got expert knowledge for just a few cents. That's how simple it is - data becomes earning agents powered by X402.

X402 isn't just a payment standard - it's the infrastructure to redefine content monetization. Thank you!
